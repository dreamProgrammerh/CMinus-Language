# TODO / Ideas / Things To Think About

This file is **not documentation**.

It is a place to:
- drop raw ideas
- note features that need discussion
- remember unfinished work
- collect frequently requested features
- write things down before they are forgotten

Nothing here is final.  
Syntax, behavior, and even existence may change.

---

## Linking

### Static library linking

```c
llink "opengl32";
````

Notes:

* compile-time only
* maps to system linker
* syntax seems OK but not final

---

### Dynamic library linking (runtime)

* no syntax yet
* likely via runtime API, not language syntax
* platform-dependent
* needs discussion

---

## Bit / Memory Layout Types

Idea: explicit bit-level layout types for packets, protocols, hardware, etc.

```c
layout: 16 BCPpacket {
    0..1:  u8 action;
    2..8:  u32 state;
    9..15: u8 value;
    9..10: bool lastPacket;
}
```

Notes:

* layout size explicitly declared
* bit ranges are inclusive
* bit overlap is allowed but must be handled carefully
* underlying type only used for cast on access
* unused bits in the type are zeroed
* syntax mostly works but needs validation rules

Things to decide:

* alignment rules
* endianness
* whether layout types can nest
* interaction with structs / unions

---

## Compile-Time Decisions (`decision`)

Idea: select implementation at compile time instead of branching at runtime.

```c
decision toNumber(str s, final u16 base) {
    case base == 16: fastStrToHex(s);
    case base == 10: fastStrToDec(s);
    case base == 2:  fastStrToBin(s);
}
```

Notes:

* works only when some parameters are `final`
* compiler chooses one path
* other paths disappear
* intended to replace slow generic functions

Needs discussion:

* syntax vs `switch`
* error handling
* diagnostics when no case matches

---

### Decision with compile-time literals

```c
decision align(str s, literal["up", "down", "left", "right"] dir) {
    case dir == "up":    optimizedUpAlign(s);
    case dir == "down":  fasterDownAlign(s);
    case dir == "left":  reverseAlignOf(s, dir);
    case dir == "right": ...
}
```

Call site:

```c
align("\n   Hello   \n", "left");
```

Lowered to:

```c
reverseAlignOf("\n   Hello   \n", "left");
```

Feels like controlled source replacement but type-safe.

---

## Compile-Time Literals (`literal`)

Idea: value-restricted types (similar to TS literal types).

### Union literal types

```c
literal{ u8 | bool } a;
```

```c
a = true;     // ok
a = 10u8;     // ok
a = 10;       // no
a = 10u16;    // no
```

Runtime values are rejected:

```c
int x = 10;
a = x; // invalid
```

---

### Strict literal sets

```c
literal["up" | "down" | "left" | "right"] dir;
```

Only these exact values are allowed.

---

### Mixed literal sets

```c
literal[
    "red" | "green" | "blue" |
    0xFF0000 | 0x00FF00 | 0x0000FF |
    true | null
] color;
```

Notes:

* literals only
* `none` is not a literal
* compile-time only
* erased after compilation

---

## Open Questions / Needs Discussion

* relationship between `decision` and generics
* how far literal types should go
* whether bit-layout types are worth the complexity
* static vs runtime linking ergonomics
* diagnostics and error messages
* which of these deserve real documentation

---

## Reminder

If it feels half-baked, **it belongs here**.
If it feels stable, **move it to real docs**.

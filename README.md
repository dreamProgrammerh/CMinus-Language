# CMinus-Language
CMinus is a modern overwrite of the C language, not to replace it, but to extend its capabilities. By removing repetitive boilerplate and overcoming certain historical limitations, by modernizes syntax so you can write less code and build more—without sacrificing C’s power.  ~fewer lines, clearer intent, and less overhead~
